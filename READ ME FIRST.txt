Greetings!

Here is the rough draft of our code. Please open the index file for the homepage first. The navigation bar above contains all the tabs of the website. 

Here is what are team wishes to achieve:
1. The Add Recipe page, through forum style, must save the data the user inputs.
2. The input data must be stored in a server.
3. The data then will be categorized on which tab is must appear.
4. The data then should be formatted according to the Recipe Page.

We would appreciate you input and advice on our plans. 

Thank you.
