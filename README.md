# CookingMamasWebsite
Greetings!

Here is a rough draft of our code. Our project is a cooking recipe website wherein the user can also upload their own recipe.
Through using forms in our code, the user can type in their recipe.
Our team still aims to accomplish the following:
- Create a server to save the data input by the user.
- process the data recieved and categorize the recipe in its respective meal tab.
- the data input must be automatically formated according to the recipe page.

We hope for your thoughts and suggestions to our current plan.

note: all code is under the merge file branch and the homepage is index.html
